About
-----

kobocat is the data collection platform used in KoBoToolbox. It is based on the excellent `onadata <http://github.com/onaio/onadata>`_ platform developed by Ona LLC, which in itself is a redevelopment of the `formhub <http://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub>`_ platform developed by the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University.

Please refer to `dist-kobo-devel <https://github.com/kobotoolbox/dist-kobo-devel>`_ for  instructions on how to install KoBoToolbox.

Code Structure
--------------

* **logger** - This app serves XForms to and receives submissions from
  ODK Collect and Enketo.

* **viewer** - This app provides a csv and xls export of the data stored in
  logger. This app uses a data dictionary as produced by pyxform. It also
  provides a map and single survey view.

* **main** - This app is the glue that brings logger and viewer
  together.
